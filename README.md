==========

### Left to do.
* [Fred] AntiGravityDrive: compute scalar product as to avoid escape angle to lead straight to an enemy bot.
* Spinning Radar: Adapt target locking to RoboVampires cases.
* Build a new radar that mixes Spinning and Locking.
* [Flo] List scenaris (i.e. different phases of the game)
* [Flo] Define scenario to flee to safe area.
* [Eddy] Prepare painting framework

### Some thoughts

* Distinguish strategies depending on gane phases:
  - Initial: explore
  - Robovamp sleeping
  - Robovamp awake
  - Robovamp killed
  - 1-vs-1
